Part A:

1.	Text File: 		inode, length, a count
	Directory: 		inode, length
	Symbolic Link: 	Same as text file with same values since its a link of the tested file
		*ln -s "source file" "linking file"
	Device File: 	inode, length (0)
		*mknod <name> <type of device c:- character b:- block device etc> <major> <minor>
		*mknod test_device c 89 1

2.	identical to stat but when taking in a symbolic link, it returns the information about the symbolic link not the file.

3.	i tried for an hour and couldent get it working, readlink() should return the number of bytes placed in the buffer, and will truncate the content.
	Notes: define some buffer size in the beginning, around line 15, enter the conditios with the static buffer and readlink(2)

Part B:

1.	it shows the inodes of files.

2.	the file foo has a logical size of 268435456 bytes. and the physical size is 268439552.
		*ls -s --block-size=1 foo
	
	foo2 logical 268435456 / physical 8388608 The physical size is significantly smaller than the logical size
	
3.	foo now consumes less phisical size but the same logical size.
	foo2 consumes more phisical space but the same logical size.
	
4.	fsck.ext4 -p foo
	*man 8 fsck
	*man 5 fs
	
5.	no i do not see the file anymore

6.	/dev/loop0 is mounted to /mnt
	it is a virtual device to make files accessible as a block device. 

7.	yes it is back to how it was before

8.	-rw-rw-r-- 1 student student 268435456 Oct  9 12:13 foo
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 student student 268435456 Oct  9 12:26 foo
	it prevents foo from being truncated, prevent it from shrinking or extending the file to a specific size
	
9.	
	```
		NTFS signature is missing.
		Failed to mount '/dev/loop0': Invalid argument
		The device '/dev/loop0' doesn't seem to have a valid NTFS.
		Maybe the wrong device is used? Or the whole disk instead of a
		partition (e.g. /dev/sda, not /dev/sda1)? Or the other way around?
	```
	
10.	by running mkfs.ext4 again after running dd without conv=notrunc
