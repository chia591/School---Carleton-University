1.	compiled

2.	In the input of the program it says what process is running in the background, where the output is the exiting
	when running ls in the background it runs fine but when trying to run bc it not responsive and has to be killed using another terminal
	similarly, running top in the background it brings it directly to the forground
	it is making a fork of the program and running it in the background with pid.
	
3.	you can recover by opening another ssh terminal and killing it with "killall -9 'program name'"
	ps aux | grep "program name" -> to show the list of active processes with the program name

4.	using ">" *do not put a space example: "ls >ls.out"*

5.	(pid == -1) means that there is no child process to wait for. so it returns a -1 *aka failed*

6.	puts(fn);
	in the function find_binary

7.	"killall -SIGUSR1 3000shell"
	adding -SIGUSR1 as a signal to the code and an error at the end
		if (the_signal != SIGCHLD){fprintf(stderr, "Ouch!");} 
	 
8.	after removing it, it exited the shell and does not restart

9.	the interface functionality does not change but the coding functionality changes,
