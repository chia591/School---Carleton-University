1. 	a) `lsb_release -a` -> Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS
	b) `echo $0` -> -zsh (i changed it, if i want to acess bash again i can enter the command `bash`)
	c) `htop` -> shows the equivelant of task manager on windows
	
2.	opens up the manual for a certain command

3.	using `type [command]` it will tell us if it is builtin or external, three external commands: cat, vim and nano

4.	you can find documentation online, i used https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux
	to add a directory to the path you use the `export path=$PATH:/the/directory/` command
	to add the command permenantly, the above command has to be added to the configuration file in the shell, located at ~/.bashrc for bash
	
5.	using the command `ls -l /path/of/command/that/is/external/` it will return something similar to this:
		"-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 43416 Sep  5  2019 /usr/bin/cat"
	to who the owner of the file is what follows after the 1 
		in this case: root
	and the group is right after that
		also: root

6.	where permissions are seperated by user, group and others.
		r = read
		w = write
		x = execute

7.	"/etc/passwd"	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2226 Sep 10 10:34 /etc/passwd
		- owner and group is both root, permissions is only read and write
		- User account information
		
	"/etc/shadow"	-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1359 Sep 10 10:38 /etc/shadow
		- owner is root but the group is shadow, permissions is only to read and write
		- Secure user account information
		
8.	Allows the user to enter the directory and acess the files and directories inside of it.

9.	Using -l allows you to see permission bits
	Using -a allows you to see all files including hidden files
	to make a file hidden, adding a `.` to the start of its name hides it
	
10. - it shows processes that have been made and when its completed.
	- you cant use up and down arrow to return to previous commands
	- i cant find external commands when doing `type cat`
