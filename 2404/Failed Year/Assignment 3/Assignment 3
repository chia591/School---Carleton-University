Andy Chia - 101111058 - COMP2404 Assignment 3

Purpose: A system that stores books in a library with a cheke in and check out system

Files: Book.cc Book.h Control.cc Control.h Library.cc Library.h List.cc List.h Logger.cc Logger.h main.cc MakeFile View.cc View.h "Assignment 3 - COMP2404.png"

How to run:
    Make
    ./a3

Notes: There is currently a problem with the del(b->getId()) functions called in CheckOutLogger::update(Book* b), i have tried pinpointing the problem by trying to isolate the function but
        Sadly the problem is between b->getId() and the del() function, since del does not get called at all and getId() works fine. But in CheckInLogger::update(Book* b) the del() appears
        to work perfectly fine.
